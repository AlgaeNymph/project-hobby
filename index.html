    <p>My whole life I’ve always wanted to play god, but how can I do that when 
    I’m a squishy mortal?  From my observations, the easiest way of creating 
    worlds is by imagining them into existence, something we’ve certainly been 
    doing since oral mythology.  However, if we want our worlds to last we need 
    a more permanent medium than complex memes.  That is essentially what 
    writing is, and why it’s a hobby of mine.  With writing, anyone with the 
    basest of tools can be divinely empowered to create reality as they feel it 
    should be.</p>
    
    <p>Something to write with and on are the bare minimums, but if you’re 
    reading this you almost certainly have a text editor.  Windows machines come
    with WordPad, while Macs come with TextEdit.  At the very least you’ll want 
    one that automatically checks your spelling, meaning Windows users will have
    to download one.  Thankfully, a search for ‘free windows text editor’ 
    provides many options, both downloadable and online.  That’s really it as 
    far as what you physically need for writing, but doesn’t begin to cover 
    writing well.</p>
    
    <p>To write fiction well you’ll need to not only know the rules of your 
    language but how to create an entertaining story.  Reams worth of words 
    have been written on these subjects, but I can thankfully connect you to 
    those who can teach writing better than I can.  So as not to overwhelm you 
    I’ll start with the best three.  The 
    <a href=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/>Purdue Online Writing Lab</a> will 
    help avoid both the worst blunders and the ire of English-majors turned editors. 
    <a href=http://www.springhole.net/index.html>Springhole</a> offers organized
    and comprehensive advice by topic, and even random generators to help with 
    creativity.  Lastly, <a href=https://wordcounter.net/>Wordcounter</a> not only provides a word count of what you 
    pasted but also a detailed analysis, including the reading level.</p>
